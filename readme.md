Black hole group BibTeX database
======================

This is the BibTeX database for the [Black Hole Group](https://rodrigonemmen.com/group/) @ IAG USP, with over 1000 references in black hole and high energy astrophysics as well as an auxiliary TeX file with abbreviations of common astrophysics journals.

* *journals.tex* - abbreviations of journals for bibliography
* *refs.bib* - bibtex file

# How to use the database


Make sure the end of your latex document has the line

Everybody is welcome to add references to the database and keep it growing. :simple_smile:

Just add papers to the database in the usual bibtex way, commit your file and push to this repo.
