@article{Thompson2019,
	abstract = {As material falls toward a black hole, it heats up and emits x-rays. Almost all black holes are discovered by this x-ray emission. Thompson et al. observed light from a giant star that is Doppler shifted, indicating an orbit around a binary companion. The companion object must weigh more than 2.6 solar masses, but it emits no light, including x-rays. This indicates the presence of a black hole that is not currently consuming any material. There may be a population of similarly hidden black holes that have been missed by x-ray observations. Science, this issue p. 637 A binary star contains a noninteracting compact object, probably a previously hidden black hole. Black hole binary systems with companion stars are typically found via their x-ray emission, generated by interaction and accretion. Noninteracting binaries are expected to be plentiful in the Galaxy but must be observed using other methods. We combine radial velocity and photometric variability data to show that the bright, rapidly rotating giant star 2MASS J05215658+4359220 is in a binary system with a massive unseen companion. The system has an orbital period of ~83 days and near-zero eccentricity. The photometric variability period of the giant is consistent with the orbital period, indicating star spots and tidal synchronization. Constraints on the giant's mass and radius imply that the unseen companion is 3.3−0.7+2.8 solar masses, indicating that it is a noninteracting low-mass black hole or an unexpectedly massive neutron star.},

@article{Barr2024,
	abstract = {Some compact objects observed in gravitational wave events have masses in the gap between known neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). The nature of these mass gap objects is unknown, as is the formation of their host binary systems. We report pulsar timing observations made with the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) of PSR J0514−4002E, an eccentric binary millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851. We found a total binary mass of 3.887 $\pm$ 0.004 solar masses (M⊙), and multiwavelength observations show that the pulsar's binary companion is also a compact object. The companion's mass (2.09 to 2.71 M⊙, 95\% confidence interval) is in the mass gap, indicating either a very massive NS or a low-mass BH. We propose that the companion formed in a merger between two earlier NSs. There is a substantial gap between the masses of the heaviest measured neutron star and the lightest measured black hole. This mass gap carries information about how both types of object form during supernovae (see the Perspective by Fishbach). Barr et al. used pulsar timing to investigate a binary system in a dense star cluster. They found that the pulsar's binary companion is an object in the mass gap, but could not determine whether it is an unusually high-mass neutron star or an unusually low-mass black hole. Either way, the authors argue that it formed by the earlier merger of two other neutron stars. ---Keith T. Smith Radio timing of a pulsar indicates that it has a binary companion in the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes.},

	abstract = {{X-ray binaries exhibit a soft spectral state comprising thermal blackbody emission at 1 keV and a power-law tail above 10 keV. Empirical models fit the high-energy power-law tail to radiation from a non-thermal electron distribution, but the physical location of the non-thermal electrons and the reason for their power-law index and high-energy cut-off are still largely unknown. Here, we propose that the non-thermal electrons originate from within the black hole's innermost stable circular orbit (the `plunging region'). Using an analytic model for the plunging region dynamics and electron distribution function properties from particle-in-cell simulations, we outline a steady-state model that can reproduce the observed spectral features. In particular, our model reproduces photon indices of Γ ≳ 2 and power-law luminosities of the order of a few per cent of the disc luminosity for strong magnetic fields, consistent with observations of the soft state. Because the emission originates so close to the black hole, we predict that the power-law luminosity should strongly depend on the system inclination angle and black hole spin. This model could be extended to the power-law tails observed above 400 keV in the hard state of X-ray binaries.}},

@article{Schutte2022,
	abstract = {Black-hole-driven outflows have been observed in some dwarf galaxies with active galactic nuclei1, and probably play a role in heating and expelling gas (thereby suppressing star formation), as they do in larger galaxies2. The extent to which black-hole outflows can trigger star formation in dwarf galaxies is unclear, because work in this area has previously focused on massive galaxies and the observational evidence is scarce3--5. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy previously reported to have a central massive black hole6--9, although that interpretation has been disputed because some aspects of the observational evidence are also consistent with a supernova remnant10,11. At a distance of approximately 9 Mpc, it presents an opportunity to resolve the central region and to determine if there is evidence for a black-hole outflow influencing star formation. Here we report optical observations of Henize 2-10 with a linear resolution of a few parsecs. We find an approximately 150-pc-long ionized filament connecting the region of the black hole with a site of recent star formation. Spectroscopy reveals a sinusoid-like position--velocity structure that is well described by a simple precessing bipolar outflow. We conclude that this black-hole outflow triggered the star formation.},
